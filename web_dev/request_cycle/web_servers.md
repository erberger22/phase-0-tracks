1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux was created with the assumption that the user was computer literate, and so does not have many of the safeguards that prevent a user from messing up the system. The idea is that, with no safeguards preventing a user from doing stupid things, there is no barrier preventing a creative and competent user from doing wonderful and clever things.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a portion of a server somewhere that the user 'rents' to use for whatever they want. It functions as a full and complete server, but with only as much space as you rent/need. It can be useful for working on small projects that only need a small amount of space, because you save money by only renting the space that you need. As your project grows you can increase the size of your VPS to fit your needs. You have a very high level of control over your VPS because the owner has root access and can customize the VPS to fit their individual needs.

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The root user of the system has complete control over everything, so running programs as the root user can allow for greater security risks. There are checks and limits to what a normal user account can do and has access to, but the root user is seen by the system as the head administrator, and will do what it says without double checking or looking for errors. If a mistake is made by the root user, there is no safeguards in place to prevent any damage it might do.
