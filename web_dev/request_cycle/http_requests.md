2. What is the difference between a GET and POST request?

A GET requests data, from a server or where ever that data is being held. A POST request submits data to a location for processing.

A GET is used to view some data, so to view the results of a survey would use a GET request. A POST request would be used when you submit your response to that survey. The data in your response would be processed and implemented into the survey results. 

3. What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

Cookies are small bits of data that is stored on a computer by the web browser. These can be used for all manner of things that relate to individual use of the browser. Some common ones involve storing passwords or maintaining a "logged in" status for an individual user. If a website is being visited for the first time and it uses cookies, it will create a cookie for that site. Returning to that site will access the previously created cookie and specific info about previous sessions will be used for each subsequent visit.
