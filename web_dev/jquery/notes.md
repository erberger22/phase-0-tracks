1. ~30 min Get a summary of what Jquery is. Use time to find a cheat sheat for syntax and, if possible some example code 

2. ~20 min Once familiar with what jquery is, find a page to test some simple things on, or build something simple to test.

3. ~50 min Tinker with test and try to use jquery in different ways. Avoid copying code from resources. Make errors and then correct them

4. ~20 min Make notes on the key aspects of jquery, since you are now somewhere between slightly proficient and a complete master.

I ended up only loosley sticking to my plan. Took 20 min of reading about jquery and then found a handy getting started guide. Used that along with my cheat sheat to tinker for a while. Made buttons and windows that did things on my page and just tried different things for a while until I felt I had a good understanding of it. Then I one more thing with a clear goal in mind and spoke outloud about what each command was doing as I typed it to make sure I had a good grasp of what was happening.
